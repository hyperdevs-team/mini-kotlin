<details open><summary>Groovy</summary>

Add this to your main `build.gradle`:
```groovy
buildscript {
    ext {
        ksp_version = "1.7.0-1.0.6"
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath "com.google.devtools.ksp:com.google.devtools.ksp.gradle.plugin:$ksp_version"
    }
}
```

And this to your module's `build.gradle`
```groovy
apply plugin: "com.google.devtools.ksp"

ksp "com.github.hyperdevs-team.mini-kotlin:mini-processor:$mini_version"
```

</details>

<details><summary>Kotlin</summary>

Add this to your main `build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        val kspVersion = "1.7.0-1.0.6"
        classpath("com.google.devtools.ksp:com.google.devtools.ksp.gradle.plugin:${kspVersion}")
    }
}
```
And this to your module's `build.gradle.kts`
```groovy
plugins {
    id "com.google.devtools.ksp"
}

ksp("com.github.hyperdevs-team.mini-kotlin:mini-processor:${miniVersion}")
```
